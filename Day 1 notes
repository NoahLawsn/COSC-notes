*Practical Exercise 0-2*
FizzBuzz is an interview question that is said to filter out 99.5% of programming job candidates.
Modify deliverable.py so that it takes a number from the user and prints it (the number) if it isn't divisible by 3 or 5. 
For multiples of 3 print 'fizz' instead. For multiples of 5 print 'buzz' instead. For multiples of 3 and 5 print 'fizzbuzz'.
