  *Practical Exercise 0-2*
  
  FizzBuzz is an interview question that is said to filter out 99.5% of programming job candidates.
  Modify deliverable.py so that it takes a number from the user and prints it (the number) if it isn't divisible by 3 or 5. 
  For multiples of 3 print 'fizz' instead. For multiples of 5 print 'buzz' instead. For multiples of 3 and 5 print 'fizzbuzz'.
  *END*

  #!/usr/bin/env python3
  num = input("Enter ur number\n>> ")
  num = int(num)
  if num%3 == 0 and num%5 != 0:
      print("fizz")
  elif num%5 == 0 and num%3 != 0:
      print("buzz")
  elif num%5 == 0 and num%3 == 0:

   format example:
    a = 'bob'
    b = 'susan'
    'Hi, {}. I am {}'.format(a,b) -> Hi, susan. I am bob
    
*Practical Exercise 0-3*

Modify deliverable.py and implement `guess_number` so that it repeatedly asks the user for a number between 0 and 100 inclusive. 
If the user correctly guesses the value of the given argument `n`, print "WIN" and exit out of the loop. Otherwise indicate whether 
the guess was "too high" or "too low". Test the deliverable manually or run `python3 check.py` to run the supplied unit tests.
